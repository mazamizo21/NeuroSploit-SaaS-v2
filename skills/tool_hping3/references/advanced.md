# Advanced Techniques

## Scan & Probe Modes
- Use `--scan` for targeted port scans and TCP flag selection (e.g., `-S` for SYN) for controlled probing.
- Use `--flood` only with explicit authorization due to high traffic volume.

## Evidence
- Record flags, port ranges, and rate settings used for each probe.
