# Advanced Techniques

## Ingest Strategy
- Build ingest profiles that enable only the modules you need (timeline, keyword search, hash lookup, email/web artifact extraction).
- Use keyword search with case sensitivity/whole-word controls and keep search term sets versioned for auditability.

## Evidence
- Preserve the ingest module list and keyword search terms used for each case.
