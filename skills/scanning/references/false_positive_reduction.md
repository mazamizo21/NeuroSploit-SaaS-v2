# False Positive Reduction

## Goals
1. Validate scanner findings before reporting.
2. Reduce noise in final reports.
3. Record validation evidence for each finding.

## Safe Checks
1. Reproduce with a minimal manual request.
2. Cross-check with service banners and configs.
3. Confirm the finding applies to the observed version or endpoint.
4. Mark unconfirmed findings as needs-review.

## Evidence Checklist
1. Validation steps noted with request/response evidence.
2. Confirmed vs unconfirmed findings.
3. Rationale for false positives or mitigations.
