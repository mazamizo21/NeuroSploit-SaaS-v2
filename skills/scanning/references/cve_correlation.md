# CVE Correlation

## Goals
1. Map detected versions to likely CVEs.
2. Avoid overstating unvalidated findings.
3. Record evidence supporting version to CVE mapping.

## Safe Checks
1. Use version fingerprints and public advisories.
2. Validate with low-impact checks.
3. Confirm product edition and build where possible.
4. Note backported patches or vendor-specific fixes.

## Evidence Checklist
1. Version and CVE mapping notes with source references.
2. Validation evidence or rationale for likely exposure.
3. Any conflicting fingerprints or uncertainty notes.
