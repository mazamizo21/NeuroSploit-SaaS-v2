description: >
  Systematic vulnerability identification using automated scanners (nuclei, nmap NSE,
  nikto, sqlmap, testssl), manual validation, and CVE correlation. Service-aware scanning
  with false positive reduction and evidence-based reporting.

inputs:
  - ports.json
  - services.json
  - tech_fingerprint.json
  - endpoints.json
outputs:
  - vulns.json
  - findings.json
  - scan_findings.json
  - evidence.json
prerequisites:
  - reconnaissance
evidence_collection:
  - Raw scanner output (nuclei JSON, nmap XML, nikto report)
  - Manual validation with curl request/response
  - CVE correlation with version evidence
  - False positive analysis and severity calibration
  - Exploit-DB matches with searchsploit
success_criteria:
  - Vulnerabilities identified with validated evidence
  - False positives reduced through manual verification
  - Service-specific scans completed for all discovered services
  - CVE correlation performed for all versioned services
safety_notes:
  - Use conservative rate limits on external targets (50-100 req/s max)
  - No destructive nuclei templates unless explicitly authorized
  - Validate findings before reporting to minimize false positives
  - Stagger scans to avoid overwhelming target services
  - SQLMap only on discovered injectable parameters, never blind
