name: C2 Deployment
category: exploitation
phase: EXPLOIT
priority: 95
target_types:
  - lab
  - external
description: >
  After gaining initial access through exploitation, generate a Sliver C2
  implant tailored to the target OS/arch, deliver it via the appropriate
  method (download, upload, injection), and confirm callback reception.
  This is the bridge between exploitation and post-exploitation.
