# Advanced Techniques

## Mode Selection
- Use `-r` for a fully random MAC, `-A` for a random vendor MAC, and `-p` to reset to permanent.
- Use `-m XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX` when you need a specific address and `-b` to keep the same vendor.

## Evidence
- Capture before/after MAC addresses and the interface used.
