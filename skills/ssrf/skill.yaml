description: >
  Detect and exploit SSRF vulnerabilities to access internal services, cloud metadata,
  and pivot into internal networks. Covers URL parsing bypasses, protocol smuggling,
  DNS rebinding, redirect chains, and cloud IMDS exploitation (AWS/GCP/Azure).
mitre_techniques:
  - T1190  # Exploit Public-Facing Application
  - T1552.005  # Cloud Instance Metadata API
  - T1046  # Network Service Scanning

inputs:
  - services.json
  - vulns.json
outputs:
  - evidence.json
  - findings.json
  - cloud_metadata.json
prerequisites:
  - vulns
success_criteria:
  - SSRF confirmed with internal resource access proof
  - Cloud metadata extracted or internal service enumerated
  - All payloads and responses documented
safety_notes:
  - Never access production cloud metadata without authorization
  - Internal port scanning may trigger IDS/IPS
  - DNS rebinding requires external infrastructure
  - Document all internal IPs and services discovered
