# Advanced Techniques

## Level & Risk
- `--level` controls breadth of tests and which parameters are tested.
- `--risk` controls potentially dangerous payloads (e.g., OR‑based).

## Targeting
- Use `-p` to constrain parameters; `--skip` and `--param-exclude` to avoid noisy parameters.
- Use `-r` request files for complex authenticated flows.
