# GitHub Playbook

## Identification Hints
- GitHub repos and API endpoints are public; use official APIs or `gh` for inventory.

## Safe Checks
1. Inventory orgs and repos using read-only queries.
2. Capture branch protection and required status checks.
3. Validate token scopes for least-privilege.

## Evidence Capture
- Repo visibility, default branch, protection rules.
- Auth scope summary and audit logging settings.
