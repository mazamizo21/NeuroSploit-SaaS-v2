# Advanced Techniques

## Subcommands and Graph DB
- Use `intel` for OSINT, `enum` for DNS enumeration, and `viz` for graph outputs.
- The graph database and output directory persist across runs to support tracking.

## Controlled Enumeration
- Use `-active` and `-brute` only when explicitly authorized.
- Use `-config` and `-dir` to control data sources and output location.

## Evidence
- Capture the data sources (`-src`) and resolved IPs (`-ip`) when needed.
