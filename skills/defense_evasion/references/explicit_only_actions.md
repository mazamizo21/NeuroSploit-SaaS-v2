# Explicit-Only Actions

## Scope Gate
Disabling or modifying security controls requires explicit authorization and is not part of default validation.

## Evidence Guidelines
1. Document misconfigurations without attempting bypass.
2. Capture configuration evidence only.
3. Record authorization scope and operator identity.
