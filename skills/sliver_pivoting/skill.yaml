description: >
  Pivot through compromised hosts to reach internal networks using Sliver C2
  port forwarding, SOCKS5 proxying, reverse port forwards, and named pipe
  pivots. Enables scanning and exploitation of hosts not directly reachable
  from the attack platform.

evidence_collection:
  - Port forward configurations
  - SOCKS proxy setup
  - Internal network scan results
  - Lateral movement proof (whoami on pivoted hosts)
success_criteria:
  - Port forward or SOCKS proxy established
  - Internal hosts accessible through pivot
  - At least one lateral movement path validated
safety_notes:
  - Only pivot to in-scope hosts
  - Document all tunnels for cleanup
  - Monitor bandwidth usage to avoid detection
  - Close all tunnels after engagement
