description: >
  Establish persistent access through Sliver C2 using multiple persistence
  mechanisms: registry run keys, scheduled tasks, services, cron jobs, systemd
  units, SSH key injection, DLL hijacking, and WMI event subscriptions.
  Ensures C2 reconnection survives reboots and user logoffs.

evidence_collection:
  - Persistence mechanism installed
  - Survival test (reboot + reconnection)
  - Registry/service/task entries created
  - Cleanup commands documented
success_criteria:
  - Persistence survives reboot
  - C2 session re-established after reboot
  - Cleanup procedure documented
safety_notes:
  - Only install persistence on authorized targets
  - Always document what was installed for cleanup
  - Prefer reversible mechanisms (tasks > drivers)
  - External engagements require explicit persistence authorization
