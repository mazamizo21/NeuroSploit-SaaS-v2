# Exploitation Skill

## Overview
Validate exploitation paths in a controlled manner to confirm impact.

## Scope Rules
1. Only operate on explicitly authorized targets.
2. External targets: exploitation requires explicit authorization (external_exploit=explicit_only).
3. Prefer non-destructive validation and stop after proof.

## Methodology

### 1. Targeted Exploit Selection
- Use confirmed findings and versions
- Prefer non-destructive validation

### 1.1 Exploit-DB & MITRE Correlation (Required)
- Use Exploit-DB locally before ad-hoc payloads.
- Search with `searchsploit` using exact product/version strings (capture output).
- If you need structured results, parse `/usr/share/exploitdb/files_exploits.csv` with a quick `python3` one-liner.
- Record evidence to `evidence/exploitdb.txt` (or `exploitdb.json`) and cite the EDB-ID.
- When a vuln is confirmed, include a MITRE technique ID in memory tags, e.g.:
  - `[REMEMBER: vulnerability_found] SQL Injection (T1190) at /login`

### 2. Minimal Proof of Impact
- Demonstrate impact with least privilege
- Capture evidence and stop

### 3. Containment
- Avoid persistence unless explicitly authorized

## Deep Dives
Load references when needed:
1. Target selection: `references/target_selection.md`
2. Proof of impact: `references/proof_of_impact.md`
3. Containment: `references/containment.md`
4. Explicit-only actions: `references/explicit_only_actions.md`

## MITRE ATT&CK Mappings
- T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application
- T1203 - Exploitation for Client Execution

## Tools Available
- metasploit
- sqlmap
- commix
- searchsploit (Exploit-DB)
- exploitdb (local CSV)

## Evidence Collection
1. Exploit output logs.
2. Proof of access.
3. `evidence.json` with scope approvals and minimal proof artifacts.
4. `findings.json` with confirmed impact notes.
5. `evidence/exploitdb.txt` or `evidence/exploitdb.json` for EDB lookups.

## Success Criteria
- Exploit validated safely
- Evidence captured and documented
