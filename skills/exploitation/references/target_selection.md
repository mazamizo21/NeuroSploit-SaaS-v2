# Targeted Exploit Selection

## Goals
1. Use validated findings and versions only.
2. Prefer non-destructive validation.
3. Record exploit selection rationale and scope approval.

## Safe Practices
1. Confirm service version and vulnerability mapping.
2. Avoid broad exploit attempts.
3. Use proof-of-impact only after validation.
