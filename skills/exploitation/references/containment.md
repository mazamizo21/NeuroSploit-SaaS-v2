# Containment and Safety

## Goals
1. Avoid persistence or lateral movement unless explicitly authorized.
2. Minimize system impact.
3. Record any changes made and rollback steps.

## Safe Practices
1. Use read-only validation where possible.
2. Document any changes made.
3. Confirm cleanup before ending the session.
