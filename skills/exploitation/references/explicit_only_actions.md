# Explicit-Only Actions

## Scope Gate
Exploitation actions require explicit authorization, especially for external targets.

## Evidence Guidelines
1. Capture minimal proof only.
2. Avoid persistence unless explicitly authorized.
3. Record authorization scope and operator identity.
4. Document cleanup and rollback confirmation.
