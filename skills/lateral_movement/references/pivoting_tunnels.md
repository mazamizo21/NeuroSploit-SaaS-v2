# Pivoting and Tunnels

## Goals
1. Establish limited, documented pivots within scope.
2. Avoid persistence or long-lived tunnels without approval.
3. Record tunnel endpoints and duration clearly.

## Safe Practices
1. Use short-lived tunnels for validation only.
2. Document endpoints, ports, and duration.
3. Tear down immediately after validation.

## Evidence Checklist
1. Tunnel parameters (redacted).
2. Purpose and duration.
3. Source and destination evidence.
