# Network Mapping for Lateral Movement

## Goals
1. Identify reachable hosts and services within scope.
2. Avoid noisy scanning or brute force.
3. Record source host and path assumptions.

## Safe Checks
1. Use existing recon outputs.
2. Validate reachability with low-rate probes.
3. Prefer passive routing and existing access logs.

## Evidence Checklist
1. Reachable host list.
2. Service summary per host.
3. Evidence of routing path and source node.
