# Active Directory Movement (Explicit-Only)

## Scope Gate
AD lateral movement actions require explicit authorization and must remain in scope.

## Examples
- Remote execution across domain hosts
- Ticket-based authentication reuse
- High-privilege account validation

## Evidence Guidelines
1. Minimal proof of access.
2. Document approvals and scope.
3. Record domain context and target hostnames.
