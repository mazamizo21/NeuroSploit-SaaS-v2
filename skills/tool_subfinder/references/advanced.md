# Advanced Techniques

## Source Control
- Use `-s` to include specific sources and `-es` to exclude noisy sources.
- `-recursive` limits enumeration to sources that handle nested subdomains.

## Operational Notes
- Many sources require API keys; configure provider keys before full runs.
- Use `-all` only when slower, comprehensive coverage is required.
