description: >
  Full-chain Windows penetration testing methodology. Covers credential attacks,
  SMB/RDP/SSH/WinRM exploitation, privilege escalation, persistence, and data
  exfiltration against Windows hosts. Prioritizes credential-based attacks over
  web exploitation — the way real pentesters work.

inputs:
  - services.json
outputs:
  - access.json
  - evidence.json
  - findings.json
  - credentials.json
prerequisites: []
evidence_collection:
  - Proof of access (whoami, hostname, ipconfig)
  - Credential dumps with redaction
  - Screenshot/output of privileged access
  - Data exfiltration proof
success_criteria:
  - At least one valid credential obtained
  - Remote shell or desktop access achieved
  - Privilege escalation to SYSTEM or Administrator
  - Sensitive data exfiltrated as proof
safety_notes:
  - Lab targets allow full exploitation
  - External targets require explicit authorization for credential attacks
  - Avoid account lockout — check lockout policy first
  - Do not destroy data — copy only for exfiltration proof
