# Advanced Techniques

## Enumeration Types
- Use `-t std` for baseline records and add `brt`, `rvl`, or `axfr` only when authorized.
- Use `-D` for brute-force wordlists and `--threads` to control concurrency.

## Output Control
- Save output with `-x`/`-c`/`-j` and include wildcard filtering when needed.
