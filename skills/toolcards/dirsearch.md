## Overview
- Summary: dirsearch is an advanced web path brute-forcer.

## Advanced Techniques
- Use scoped extension lists and recursion where approved.
- Prefer JSON output for structured evidence.

## Safe Defaults
- Rate limits: keep concurrency low on external targets.
- Scope rules: explicit target only.

## Evidence Outputs
- outputs: endpoints.json, findings.json (as applicable)
