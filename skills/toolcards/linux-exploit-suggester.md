# linux-exploit-suggester Toolcard

## Overview
- Summary: Linux Exploit Suggester analyzes kernel and system info to suggest potential local privilege escalation exploits.

## Advanced Techniques
- Use offline review of suggestions and cross-check with authoritative advisories.
- Treat output as triage input only, not automatic exploitation.

## Safe Defaults
- Require explicit authorization for external targets (external_exploit=explicit_only).
- Do not execute exploits; use for prioritization only.

## Evidence Outputs
- outputs: evidence.json, findings.json (as applicable)
