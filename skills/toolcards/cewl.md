# cewl Toolcard

## Overview
- Summary: CeWL is a custom wordlist generator that spiders a target website and collects words.

## Advanced Techniques
- Limit crawl depth and target only approved domains.
- Normalize output and remove duplicates before use.

## Safe Defaults
- Require explicit authorization for crawling external targets (external_exploit=explicit_only).
- Use conservative crawl rates to avoid disruption.

## Evidence Outputs
- outputs: evidence.json (as applicable)
