## Overview
- Summary: Katana is a fast web crawler for endpoint discovery.

## Advanced Techniques

- Export JSON output for evidence capture.

## Safe Defaults
- Rate limits: restrict concurrency and request rate on production.
- Scope rules: explicit target only; avoid auth bypass or injection testing unless authorized.

## Evidence Outputs
- outputs: evidence.json, findings.json (as applicable)
