# windows-exploit-suggester Toolcard

## Overview
- Summary: WES-NG is the Next Generation Windows Exploit Suggester.

## Advanced Techniques
- Use offline data review before any live validation.
- Cross-check suggested exposures against authoritative advisories.

## Safe Defaults
- Require explicit authorization for external targets (external_exploit=explicit_only).
- Do not execute exploits; treat output as triage input only.

## Evidence Outputs
- outputs: evidence.json, findings.json (as applicable)
