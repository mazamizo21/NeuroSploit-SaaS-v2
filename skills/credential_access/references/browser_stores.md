# Browser and Application Stores

## Goals
1. Identify saved passwords, cookies, and tokens.
2. Capture proof of exposure without exfiltration.
3. Record source application and access context.

## Typical Sources
- Chromium-based browser stores
- Firefox profiles
- Application secrets stores

## Safe Handling
1. Extract only minimal evidence.
2. Redact tokens, cookies, and personal data.
3. Avoid exporting full stores or databases.
