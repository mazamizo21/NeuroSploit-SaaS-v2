# Advanced Techniques

## Recovery Workflow
- Use `testdisk` for partition and filesystem recovery and `photorec` for file carving when filesystem metadata is damaged.
- Use `fidentify` to inspect file signatures in recovered output and validate carving results.

## Evidence
- Record recovery steps and output paths, including any file-type filters used.
