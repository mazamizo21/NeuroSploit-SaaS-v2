prerequisites:
  - access
  - collection
evidence_collection:
  - Exfiltration channel validation results
  - Transfer logs and receipt verification
  - Staging artifact cleanup confirmation
  - Data encryption documentation
success_criteria:
  - Exfiltration channel identified and validated
  - Data encrypted before transfer
  - Transfer completed with receipt verification
  - All staging artifacts removed
  - No detection alerts triggered
safety_notes:
  - All exfiltration requires explicit authorization with defined scope
  - Minimize data transferred — prove capability with samples not bulk dumps
  - Encrypt all data in transit and at rest
  - Rate-limit transfers to avoid volume-based alerts
  - Clean up all staging artifacts after confirmed receipt
