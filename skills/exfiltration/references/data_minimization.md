# Data Minimization

## Goals
1. Prove access with minimal data collection.
2. Avoid bulk exports or sensitive data exposure.
3. Record scope and justification for samples.

## Safe Checks
1. Sample a single row or record where allowed.
2. Redact or hash sensitive values.
3. Prefer metadata-only validation when possible.

## Evidence Checklist
1. Minimal sample evidence.
2. Redaction notes.
3. Scope reference and sample rationale.
