description: >
  Systematic discovery of hosts, ports, services, and web surface area.
  Covers passive OSINT, semi-passive web recon, and active infrastructure
  scanning with structured workflow.

evidence_collection:
  - Network scan outputs
  - Service banners and versions
  - Web tech fingerprints
  - Subdomain enumeration results
  - OSINT findings
success_criteria:
  - Open ports and services mapped
  - Web technologies identified
  - Subdomains enumerated
  - Initial attack surface documented
