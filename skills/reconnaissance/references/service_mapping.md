# Service Mapping

## Goals
1. Identify services and versions with minimal noise.
2. Build a service inventory for later phases.
3. Track confidence and evidence for each service.

## Safe Checks
1. Version detection with conservative scan options.
2. Correlate banners with known services.
3. Cross-check with TLS and HTTP fingerprints where applicable.
4. Record ambiguous or conflicting fingerprints.

## Evidence Checklist
1. Service list with host, port, protocol, and state.
2. Version hints and confidence notes.
3. Banner evidence or tool outputs supporting the identification.
