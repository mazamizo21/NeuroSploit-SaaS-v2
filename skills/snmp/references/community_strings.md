# Community Strings (Explicit-Only)

## Scope Gate
Community discovery or guessing is explicit-only.

## Safe Checks
1. Use provided community strings only.
2. Record success or failure once per host.
3. Avoid brute force or wordlists unless explicitly authorized.

## Indicators to Record
1. Default community strings in use (if explicitly authorized to test).
2. Read-write communities exposed.

## Evidence Checklist
1. Auth success logs.
2. Community string usage notes (redacted).
3. Access level evidence (RO vs RW).
