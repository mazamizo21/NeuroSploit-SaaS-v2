  - lab

description: >
  Demonstrate potential impact on target systems through controlled simulations
  including ransomware, defacement, service disruption, resource hijacking,
  data destruction proof, and denial of service testing. Evidence-only by default.
mitre_techniques:
  - T1485    # Data Destruction
  - T1486    # Data Encrypted for Impact (Ransomware)
  - T1489    # Service Stop
  - T1491    # Defacement
  - T1491.001  # Internal Defacement
  - T1491.002  # External Defacement
  - T1496    # Resource Hijacking
  - T1498    # Network Denial of Service
  - T1499    # Endpoint Denial of Service
  - T1561    # Disk Wipe

prerequisites:
  - access
  - privilege_escalation
evidence_collection:
  - Impact simulation results and screenshots
  - Rollback verification evidence
  - Service disruption measurements
  - Resource hijacking metrics
success_criteria:
  - Impact capabilities demonstrated with evidence
  - All demonstrations safely rolled back
  - No production data destroyed or permanently modified
  - Rollback verified with integrity checks
safety_notes:
  - EVIDENCE-ONLY by default — never destructive without explicit written authorization
  - Always create backups before any modification
  - Ransomware simulation uses test files only — never production data
  - Service disruption must have maximum duration and immediate restore plan
  - Confirm impact testing is in-scope before every action
  - Emergency contact must be identified before impact testing
