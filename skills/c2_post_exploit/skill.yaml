description: >
  Use an established Sliver C2 session to perform post-exploitation:
  credential dumping, privilege escalation, lateral movement, data collection,
  and persistence. Operates entirely through the C2 channel for stealth.
  The agent decides which post-exploitation actions to run based on the
  target's OS, privilege level, and network position.

prerequisites:
  - c2_session
tools:
  - sliver-client
  - python3
evidence_collection:
  - hashdump output
  - Screenshot captures
  - Credential material extracted
  - Pivot/tunnel configurations
  - Lateral movement proof (whoami on new hosts)
success_criteria:
  - Credentials extracted from target
  - Privilege escalation attempted (SYSTEM/root)
  - At least one lateral movement path validated
  - Evidence artifacts saved to output directory
safety_notes:
  - Credential material must be stored securely (encrypted at rest)
  - Lateral movement only to in-scope hosts
  - Screenshot/keylogger only on authorized targets
  - Clean up all artifacts post-engagement
