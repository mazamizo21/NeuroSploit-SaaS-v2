# Site Survey and Inventory

## Goals
- Build a baseline inventory of SSIDs, BSSIDs, channels, and encryption types.
- Capture signal strength and channel overlap for reporting.

## Notes
- Prefer passive collection; avoid client disruption.
- Record capture windows and monitor interface details.

## Evidence
- `wireless_inventory.json` should include signal strength and channel usage where possible.
- Link raw capture files in `evidence.json`.
