# Advanced Techniques

## Capture Control
- Use `-i` to select interface, `-s` to set snaplen, and `-w` to write PCAPs for later analysis.
- Rotate captures with `-C` (size), `-G` (time), and `-W` (file count), and use `-z` for post-rotate hooks when permitted.

## Evidence
- Record capture filter, snaplen, and rotation settings for each run.
