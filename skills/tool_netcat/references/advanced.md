# Advanced Techniques

## Port Checks & Timeouts
- Use zero-I/O checks for quick port validation and add explicit timeouts to avoid hangs.
- Prefer verbose mode when you need proof of connection attempts.

## Proxy Use
- Netcat can be used as a proxy command; keep proxy endpoints explicit and scoped.
