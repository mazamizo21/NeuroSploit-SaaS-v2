# Advanced Techniques

## Caplets
- Use `caplets.update` to install/update caplets and `caplets.show` to list them.
- Keep caplets minimal and scoped to the engagement.

## Discovery Modules
- `net.recon on/off` manages passive host discovery from the ARP table.
- `net.probe on/off` sends discovery probes; throttle and timebox to reduce noise.
