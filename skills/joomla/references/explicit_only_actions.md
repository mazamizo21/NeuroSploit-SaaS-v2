# Explicit-Only Actions

## Scope Gate
Credential attacks or exploit execution require explicit authorization.

## Evidence Guidelines
1. Capture minimal proof only.
2. Avoid changes or persistence.
3. Record approval scope, operator, and timestamps.
4. Document target, method, and cleanup confirmation.
